## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
comment:
  layout: "diff, flags, files"
  behavior: default
  require_changes: false
  require_base: false
  require_head: true
  hide_project_coverage: false
```

### Available Layout Components

| Component | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `diff` | Coverage diff of PR changes | **Critical** - Shows impact of PR on coverage |
| `flags` | User-defined flags and coverage impact | Multi-environment testing feedback |
| `components` | User-defined components and impact | Modular codebase organization |
| `files` or `tree` | Files impacted by PR | Detailed file-level breakdown |
| `header` | Commit info, coverage change, diff coverage | **Essential** - Quick status overview |
| `footer` | Legend, last updated commits, docs link | Reference information |
| `feedback` | Link to provide Codecov feedback | User engagement |
| `newheader` | Updated header design (2025) | Modern, emoji-enhanced summary |
| `newfooter` | Updated footer design (2025) | Cleaner reference section |

### Condensed Layout Option

For minimal visual footprint:

```yaml
comment:
  layout: "condensed_header, condensed_files, condensed_footer"
  hide_project_coverage: true
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces PR comment clutter
- Maintains essential information
- Better for high-volume PR workflows

---

## Behavior Configuration

### Comment Posting Conditions

```yaml
comment:
  behavior: default
  require_changes: false  # or true or "coverage_drop"
```

**Options**:
- `false` (default): Post comment even if no coverage change
- `true`: Only post if coverage changes (positive or negative)
- `"coverage_drop"`: Only post if coverage decreases

**Best Practice**: Use `require_changes: true` to reduce noise, or `"coverage_drop"` for strict coverage enforcement.

### Timing Control

```yaml
comment:
  after_n_builds: 2  # Wait for N reports before commenting
```

**Recommendation**: Set `after_n_builds` equal to number of uploaded reports per commit to ensure complete analysis.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Docker Engine Configuration
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "header, changes, diff, sunburst"
  behavior: default
```

**Analysis**: Includes visual sunburst chart for coverage visualization - great for large codebases.

### Example 2: Codecov Components Example
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "header, diff, flags, components"
  require_changes: yes
```

**Analysis**: Component-focused feedback with noise reduction - ideal for modular architectures.

### Example 3: Minimal Configuration
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "diff"
  require_changes: yes
```

**Analysis**: Ultra-minimal approach showing only coverage diff - best for small teams with tight PR workflows.

## Best Practices for Actionable PR Comments

### 1. **Focus on Patch Coverage**
The patch (diff coverage) is the most critical piece of information because it shows coverage of the actual changes in the PR.

**Recommended Layout**:
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "newheader, diff, files, newfooter"
  hide_comment_details: true
```

### 2. **Use Flags for Multi-Environment Feedback**
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "header, diff, flags"

flags:
  backend:
    paths:
      - backend/
  frontend:
    paths:
      - frontend/
```

**Benefit**: Separate coverage feedback for backend vs frontend changes.

### 3. **Reduce Noise with Conditional Posting**
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "newheader, diff, files"
  require_changes: "coverage_drop"
  hide_comment_details: true
```

**Benefit**: Only comments when coverage decreases, enforcing quality gates.

### 4. **Enable Quick Scanning**
- Use `newheader` with emoji indicators (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- Enable `hide_comment_details: true` for collapsible sections
- Lead with summary line showing coverage change percentage

### 5. **Integrate with Development Workflow**
- **Sentry Integration**: Coverage data in stack traces for actionable insights
- **AI Test Generation**: Auto-suggest tests for uncovered code
- **Component Filtering**: Filter by specific modules or features

## Advanced Techniques

### Custom Component Configuration
```yaml
component_management:
  individual_components:
    - component_id: "critical_path"
      paths:
        - src/payment/**
        - src/auth/**

comment:
  layout: "header, components, diff"
```

**Use Case**: Highlight coverage for business-critical paths.

### Flag-Based Differential Coverage
```yaml
flags:
  unit:
    carryforward: true
  integration:
    carryforward: true

comment:
  layout: "header, flags, diff"
```

**Use Case**: Show separate coverage for unit vs integration tests.

### Disabling Comments
```yaml
comment: false
```

**Use Case**: Disable PR comments but maintain coverage tracking in app.

## Migration Guide: Enhanced Comments

### Step 1: Add New Layout Components
```yaml
comment:
  layout: "newheader, diff, files, newfooter"
  hide_comment_details: true
```

### Step 2: Enable Conditional Posting
```yaml
comment:
  require_changes: true  # or "coverage_drop"
```

### Step 3: Configure AI Test Generation (Optional)
1. Ensure Codecov app is installed on repository
2. Enable AI features in Codecov settings
3. Comment `@codecov-ai-reviewer test` in PRs to trigger

### Step 4: Test and Iterate
- Create test PR with coverage changes
- Review comment layout and information hierarchy
- Adjust `layout` components based on team feedback

## Recommended Configuration for Kalshi Analysis Project

Based on the project structure (backend Python + frontend TypeScript):

```yaml
# codecov.yml
comment:
  # Use modern layout with quick scanning
  layout: "newheader, diff, flags, files, newfooter"

  # Only comment when coverage changes to reduce noise
  require_changes: true

  # Collapse details for cleaner PR view
  hide_comment_details: true

  # Wait for both backend and frontend coverage reports
  after_n_builds: 2

# Separate flags for backend/frontend
flags:
  backend:
    paths:
      - backend/
  frontend:
    paths:
      - frontend/

# Optional: Define critical components
component_management:
  individual_components:
    - component_id: "api"
      paths:
        - backend/api/**
    - component_id: "domain"
      paths:
        - backend/domain/**
    - component_id: "ui"
      paths:
        - frontend/src/components/**
```

**Rationale**:
- `newheader`/`newfooter`: Modern 2025 design with emoji indicators
- `flags`: Separate backend/frontend coverage feedback
- `require_changes: true`: Reduces comment noise
- `after_n_builds: 2`: Waits for both backend and frontend reports
- Component management: Highlights coverage for critical modules (API, domain logic, UI)
