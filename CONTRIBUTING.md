## ü§ù Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a simple principle: **be respectful and professional**. We're all here to learn and build cool things together.

- Be kind and constructive in feedback
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Assume good intentions
- Help others learn and grow

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python ‚â• 3.11
- Node.js ‚â• 22
- pnpm (for frontend)
- Docker + Docker Compose (recommended)
- Git

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kalshi-analysis.git
cd kalshi-analysis

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/seanbearden/kalshi-analysis.git
```

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Quick start with Docker
make demo

# Or manual setup:
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow the [Coding Standards](#coding-standards) below.

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
mypy .
ruff check .

# Frontend tests (when implemented)
cd frontend
pnpm test
pnpm type-check
pnpm lint
```

### 4. Commit Your Work

We use conventional commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add real-time WebSocket connection"
git commit -m "fix: resolve order book race condition"
git commit -m "docs: update README with deployment instructions"
git commit -m "test: add backtesting strategy unit tests"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `chore`: Build/tooling changes

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 6. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Then create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## üìê Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

**Style and Formatting:**
- Use **Ruff** for linting
- Use **Black** for formatting
- Use **mypy** for type checking
- Follow PEP 8 conventions

**Code Quality:**
- Type hints required for all functions
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Docstrings for public APIs (Google style)

**Example:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

async def fetch_market_data(
    ticker: str,
    start_date: Optional[datetime] = None,
) -> MarketSnapshot:
    """Fetch market snapshot from Kalshi API.

    Args:
        ticker: Market ticker symbol
        start_date: Optional start date for historical data

    Returns:
        Market snapshot with current prices and volume

    Raises:
        KalshiAPIError: If API request fails
    """
    ...
```

### TypeScript (Frontend)

**Style and Formatting:**
- Use **ESLint** for linting
- Use **Prettier** for formatting
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled

**Code Quality:**
- Functional components with hooks
- Type-safe props and state
- Consistent naming (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

**Example:**
```typescript
interface MarketCardProps {
  ticker: string;
  title: string;
  yesPrice: number;
  noPrice: number;
}

export function MarketCard({ ticker, title, yesPrice, noPrice }: MarketCardProps) {
  const { data, isLoading } = useMarketQuery(ticker);

  if (isLoading) return <Skeleton />;

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{title}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      {/* ... */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Frontend
cd frontend
pnpm install  # Husky hooks configured in package.json
```
